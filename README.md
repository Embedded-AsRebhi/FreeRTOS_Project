# FreeRTOS_Project
The goal of this project was to explore various FreeRTOS concepts. I successfully integrated the FreeRTOS kernel manually and adapted SEGGER SystemView to monitor application behavior. Additionally, I created two simple tasks and launched the scheduler.
In this implementation, I used the SysTick timer and enabled interrupt functions (xPortSVCHandler, xPortPendSVHandler, and xPortSysTickHandler) to ensure proper task scheduling.
